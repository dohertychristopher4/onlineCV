                    have recently attained a 1st Class (Hons) in Applied Computing at Letterkenny Institute of
                    Technology.

                    Web Development & UWP App Development are two areas in which I have excelled throughout the program
                    at LYIT. I have also developed an understanding of computer vision technologies, as a result of my
                    final year project, which delivers a people counting system. The system is implemented using OpenCV
                    and Python.

                    The system generates footfall data for businesses and can be viewed at:
                    www.headcountlive.com

                    Proficient in Javascript, PHP, HTML5, CSS, jQuery, C#, SQL, Java, Python, OpenCV, ChartJS, Linux,
                    Raspbian.

                    Intermediate experience with Underscore, Node, Mustache, Underscore, d3, C++, C, VB.NET, DevOps.

                    I also have a keen interest in all things sports, music and film.

                <p>
                    I have developed an understanding of computer vision technologies,
                    as a result of my final year project at Letterkenny IT,
                    which delivers a people counting system. The system was
                    implemented using OpenCV and Python. This footfall data was then
                    accessible in real-time via a website.

                <h3>GSM in the cloud</h3>
                <p>
                    I created a wireless bridge and a personalised app to work
                    with an uploader phone so as to enable my niece,
                    who is a type 1 diabetic, to have her glucose levels uploaded
                    to the cloud and available to her parents at all times on
                    their phones and smart watches. This is an ongoing open
                    source project which I am proud to have been able to develop
                    for my niece which makes her parents lives that little bit easier.
