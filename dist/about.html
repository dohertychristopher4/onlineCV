                    I created a wireless bridge and a personalised app to work
                    with an uploader phone so as to enable my niece,
                    who is a type 1 diabetic, to have her glucose levels uploaded
                    to the cloud and available to her parents at all times on
                    their phones and smart watches. This is an ongoing open
                    source project which I am proud to have been able to develop
                    for my niece which makes her parents lives that little bit easier.

                <p>
                    I have developed an understanding of computer vision technologies,
                    as a result of my final year project at Letterkenny IT,
                    which delivers a people counting system. The system was
                    implemented using OpenCV and Python. This footfall data was then
                    accessible in real-time via a website.
